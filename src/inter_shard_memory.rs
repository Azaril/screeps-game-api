//! `inter_shard_memory` provides an interface for communciating between shards.
//!
//! Quoted from https://docs.screeps.com/api/#InterShardMemory:
//!
//! InterShardMemory object provides an interface for communicating between
//! shards. Your script is executed separatedly on each shard, and their Memory
//! objects are isolated from each other. In order to pass messages and data
//! between shards, you need to use InterShardMemory instead.
//!
//! Every shard can have its own data string that can be accessed by all other
//! shards. A shard can write only to its own data, other shards' data is
//! read-only.
//!
//! This data has nothing to do with Memory contents, it's a separate data
//! container.
